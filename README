CONTENTS

  This distribution is my contribution to the ever growing collection
  of Tk Widgets, currently it includes

	Tk::Cloth       - An OO interface to Tk::Canvas
	Tk::TFrame      - A frame with a title
	Tk::NumEntry    - An entry widget that accepts numbers and has up/down
			  buttons for in/decrement.
	Tk::FireButton  - Button that keeps invoking command when pressed

  Tk::Pane and Tk::ProgressBar are no longer part of this
  distribution, becase they are included in standard Perl/Tk since
  800.016. For older perl/Tk's, you can still grab the old 1.0401
  Tk-GBARR distribution from CPAN.

REQUIREMENTS

  o To use this distribution Tk402.002 or better is required.
    (there are no know problem with latest Tk800 releases)
  o Some regression test use the Test.pm module (included in
    perl 5.005).  If it's not installed the tests are skipped.

CHANGES

A complete list of changes is in the Changes file.

The documentation is minimal (or even non-existant) but I was
requested to release them before my life enters a stage of
turmoil.  I hope the examples/ directory is sufficient to
understand how to use the widgets.

Please send all bugs/comments/patches directly to the ptk mailing list

	ptk@lists.stanford.edu

or to the current maintainer
