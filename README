CONTENTS

  This distribution is my contribution to the ever growing collection
  of Tk Widgets, currently it includes

	Tk::Cloth       - An OO interface to Tk::Canvas
	Tk::Pane        - A widget panner (view only part of a widget)
	Tk::TFrame      - A frame with a title
	Tk::ProgressBar - a widget to show completion status etc
	Tk::NumEntry    - An entry widget that accepts numbers and has up/down
			  buttons for in/decrement.
	Tk::FireButton  - Button that keeps invoking command when pressed

REQUIREMENTS

  o To use this distribution Tk402.002 or better is required.
    (there are no know problem with latest Tk800 releases)
  o Some regression test use the Test.pm module (included in
    perl 5.005).  If it's not installed the tests are skipped.

CHANGES

A complete list of changes is in the ChangeLog file.  Here
a short summary whats new in the release V1.04:

	All widgets:
		o Documention more like in Tk800 docs

	Tk::NumEntry
		o fixed hidden FireButton take focus
		o -textvariable now works

	Tk::NumEntryPlain
		o Fixed wrong option definition

	Tk::ProgressBar
	        o value() method now resets value to -from option
		  value when it get the undef value. (Now creating
		  a ProgressBar without args does not complain about
		  undefined values.
		

The documentation is minimal (or even non-existant) but I was
requested to release them before my life enters a stage of
turmoil.  I hope the examples/ directory is sufficient to
understand how to use the widgets.

Please send all bugs/comments/patches directly to the ptk mailing list
