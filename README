This distribution is my contribution to the ever growing collection
of Tk Widgets, currently it includes

	Tk::Cloth  - An OO interface to Tk::Canvas
	Tk::Pane   - A widget panner (view only part of a widget)
	Tk::TFrame - A frame with a title

The documentation is minimal (or even non-existant) but I was
requested to release them before my life enters a stage of
turmoil (I am moving to the US real soon). I will release
better documentation after I have settled. In the mean time
the I hope the examples directory is sufficient.

Also in the works are :-

	Tk::MenuEntry - a text entry with a menu
	Tk::Statusbar - a widget to show completion status etc
	Tk::ListMgr   - A widget that manages lists in various ways
			eg, multi column, array
	Tk::IFrame    - An index frame (ie has tabs to select which sub-frame
			is viewable)
	Tk::NumEntry  - An entry widget that accepts numbers and has up/down
			buttons for in/decrement.


These will hopefully be in the next release, but my time is very
limited at the moment. Feel free to mail me if you are interesed
in seeing what I have, but I don't feel they are ready
for release yet.

Please mail all bugs/comments directly to me <gbarr@ti.com> as I do not
read the Tk lists on a regular basis.
