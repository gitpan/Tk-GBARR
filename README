This distribution is my contribution to the ever growing collection
of Tk Widgets, currently it includes

	Tk::Cloth       - An OO interface to Tk::Canvas
	Tk::Pane        - A widget panner (view only part of a widget)
	Tk::TFrame      - A frame with a title
	Tk::ProgressBar - a widget to show completion status etc
	Tk::NumEntry    - An entry widget that accepts numbers and has up/down
			  buttons for in/decrement.

To use this distribution Tk402.002 or better is required.

The documentation is minimal (or even non-existant) but I was
requested to release them before my life enters a stage of
turmoil (I am moving to the US real soon). I will release
better documentation after I have settled. In the mean time
the I hope the examples directory is sufficient.

Also in the works are :-

	Tk::ListMgr   - A widget that manages lists in various ways
			eg, multi column, array
	Tk::IFrame    - An index frame (ie has tabs to select which sub-frame
			is viewable)
	Tk::MenuEntry - a text entry with a menu

These modules can be found in the alpha/ directory. Please feel free to
mail me any comments you have reguarding these modules.

Please mail all bugs/comments directly to me <gbarr@ti.com> as I do not
read the Tk lists on a regular basis.
