The code in this directory is VERY alpha, it is only included in the
distribution so that those who are interested can take a look.

        Tk::ListMgr   - A widget that manages lists in various ways
                        eg, multi column, array
        Tk::IFrame    - An index frame (ie has tabs to select which sub-frame
                        is viewable)
        Tk::MenuEntry - a text entry with a menu

Anyone who does look at this code, please fell free to make any comments

To run any of these scripts you must be in the top level dist directory
and run

perl alpha/script-name
