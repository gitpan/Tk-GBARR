o Enhance Slaven patch to support not only decimals
  but also real numbers


o Convert Firebutton it to a library so one could use

   use Tk::Lib::Fire;
   ...
   @ISA = qw(... Tk::Lib::Fire ... )
   ...
   $widget->bindFire(startEvent, cancalEvent);

 so one could use it with button press/release, entry up/down, ...

o When repeaddelay of keyboard is smaller than that of firebutton
  using pending <Space> events should be canceled by <Space-Release>
